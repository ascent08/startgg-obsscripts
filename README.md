# startgg-obsscripts
A set of OBS scripts to be used in tandem with start.gg tournaments

For each script, you will need to provide:
* a start.gg developer key (more information can be found [here](https://developer.start.gg/))
* an event ID (not a tournament ID)

You will also need to install the [gql](https://github.com/graphql-python/gql) Python module:
* ```pip install gql```
